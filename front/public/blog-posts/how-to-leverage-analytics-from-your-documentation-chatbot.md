# How to Leverage Analytics from Your Documentation Chatbot to Improve Docs & Support

When your users **ask AI** questions through your documentation chatbot, they reveal more than just queries — they share where your docs succeed and where they struggle. By tapping into chatbot analytics, you can continuously refine your **documentation**, boost customer satisfaction, and even reduce support load.

In this post, we’ll explore how you can use analytics from tools like [CrawlChat](https://crawlchat.app) to identify gaps, measure performance, and improve your documentation experience.

## Why Chatbot Analytics Matter for Documentation

A **chat with docs** feature doesn’t just automate answers — it also collects real-time user intent data. Every message, rating, and unresolved question can help you:

- Identify unclear or missing documentation  
- Detect patterns in repeated user questions  
- Track the accuracy and freshness of AI-generated answers  
- Prioritize documentation updates that have the biggest impact  

With structured analytics, you turn support friction into documentation insights.

## Key Analytics You Can Use from CrawlChat

CrawlChat provides rich **documentation chatbot analytics** to help teams make data-driven improvements.

### 1. **Message Scoring**
- Each AI response can be scored as *helpful* or *not helpful*  
- Average scores reveal how effectively your documentation answers user queries  
- Spot patterns by topic or category (e.g., “API setup” or “Billing”)

### 2. **Score Distribution**
- Visualize how your bot performs over time  
- Identify spikes in “not helpful” scores after a new release  
- Track progress as your docs evolve and improve

### 3. **Latest Questions Log**
- View the **most recent user questions** with timestamps  
- Detect recurring topics that might indicate unclear documentation  
- Quickly jump into unresolved questions for review or editing  

### 4. **Data Gaps & Ticket Creation**
- Convert unanswered or low-confidence responses into documentation tickets  
- Track missing topics where users frequently “ask AI”  
- Collaborate with your tech writers or support team directly from analytics  

### 5. **Knowledge Freshness**
- Track which content groups were last updated  
- Flag outdated sections in your docs or product FAQs  
- Keep your knowledge base fresh and reliable for the next AI interaction

## Turning Analytics into Documentation Improvements

Once you’ve analyzed your chatbot data, here’s how to act on it:

- **Prioritize high-frequency issues** first — they impact the most users  
- **Revise unclear sections** where “not helpful” scores are concentrated  
- **Add new examples or clarifications** based on user phrasing  
- **Sync updates regularly** so your chatbot reflects new documentation instantly  

When you use these insights proactively, your chatbot evolves from a support assistant into a **continuous feedback loop for better docs**.
