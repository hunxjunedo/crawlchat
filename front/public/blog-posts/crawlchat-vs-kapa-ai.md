AI chatbots are changing the way teams deliver documentation and support. Instead of making users dig through endless pages of docs or GitHub issues, tools like **Kapa.ai** and **CrawlChat.app** let your audience simply “Ask AI” and get instant answers.  

Both platforms aim to solve the same problem — but they take different paths. Let’s explore how they compare, and why **CrawlChat may be the better fit for most teams and communities**.

## Kapa.ai: Enterprise-Grade Accuracy

Kapa.ai has built its reputation as an **AI assistant for developer-heavy documentation**. Backed by Y Combinator, it’s trusted by SaaS companies with large engineering audiences.  

- **Focus:** Deeply technical documentation (APIs, SDKs, tutorials).  
- **Channels:** In-product chat, Slack, Discord, API integrations.  
- **Strengths:** Strong accuracy for technical queries, enterprise trust, deep analytics.  
- **Trade-off:** Pricing and setup are enterprise-oriented — great for bigger teams, but less transparent for smaller startups or communities.

## CrawlChat.app: Instant AI for Docs, Websites, and Communities

- **Multiple Channels:** Deploy “Ask AI” on your site, inside Slack, Discord, or even as an MCP server.  
- **Transparent Pricing:** Clear plans (Hobby, Starter, Pro) with page and message credits. No need for enterprise negotiations.  
- **Model Flexibility:** CrawlChat supports OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini under the hood — you don’t even need your own API keys.
