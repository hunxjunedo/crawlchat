title: Learn by reaction on Slack & Discord bots
date: 2025-08-22
type: changelog
---

Now you don't have to tag the bot and send message **learn** to make the bot learn from the conversation on both **Slack** and **Discord** bots. Instead, you can just react with 🧩 on the message you want it to learn. It also adds ✅ reaction to confirm that it successfully learnt the message.

It fetched the replies or the thread conversation and adds it to the knowledge base so that it uses it in the future answers. It helps in maintaining the chat space cleaner and clutter free.
