Now you can add **YouTube videos** as a knowledge source! Simply provide a YouTube video URL and the app will automatically extract the transcript and add it to your knowledge base. This makes it easy to include video content, tutorials, and educational content in your knowledge base.

The feature extracts transcripts from YouTube videos that have captions enabled, making video content searchable and accessible through your AI assistant.
