# Branding

The next set of customisations is for the _Web_ chatbot that you can embed on your website and the **Ask AI** button. You can configure the following UI elements so that it blends into your branding from Connect > [Customise](https://crawlchat.app/connect) page

- Background color
- Text color
- Button text
- Logo

## Welcome message

You can set a welcome message for the embed chat widget that will be shown when no question is asked. This is the best place to inform the user what to expect, how to use it or anything else you want to show to user.

## Example questions

Configure the sample questions that are frequently asked about your documentation. They show up below the welcome message one below the other. This kick starts the user interaction.

## Text input placeholder

Change the text input placeholder text to your desired one. By default it shows _Ask your question_
