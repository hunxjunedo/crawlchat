# Behaviour

There are multiple controls on CrawlChat using which you can change how the bot behaves when asked questions. Configure them as per your requirement and use case.

## Chat prmopt

Navigate to Settings > [Chat prompt](https://crawlchat.app/settings#prompt) section to configure the prompt which will be passed to the AI models. You give all the instructions here and the bot follows them.

## AI models

Go to Settings > [AI Model](https://crawlchat.app/settings#ai-model) section to select the AI model that matches your requirement. This has high impact on the quality of the answers so experiment and pict the right one.

## Show sources

It is very important to show the sources pages from knowledge base that the bot used to answer the asked question. You can enable this from Settings > [Show sources](https://crawlchat.app/settings#show-sources) section. This works on all the channels.
