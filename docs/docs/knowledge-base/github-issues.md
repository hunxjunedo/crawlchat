# Github issues

For most of the open source software, Github issues is where a lot of issues are rised, discussed, and a lot of content is available in general. You can add the Github issues to your knowledge base with just few clicks.

## Github repo URL

All you need to do is to provide the Github repo URL and that's all it takes for it.

You can also configure the **Auto update frequency** so that it always fetches the latest issues being created and keeps the existing conversations in sync.
